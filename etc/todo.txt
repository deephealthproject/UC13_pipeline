==========

1) Create a GitHub repository for this pipeline

2) Test more autoencoders, mainly which precision they obtain for detecting seizures
    With a trained autoencoder compute the reconstruction distance to all samples
    Show one histogram per class with different colors per class (start with 2 classes, but use too 3 classes)
    if 2 classes:
        class 0: normal periods
        class 1: seizure periods
    if 3 classes:
        class 0: normal periods
        class 1: pre-seizure periods (X minutes, check different values of X)
        class 2: seizure periods

3) Create autoencoders based on convolutional layers to obtain embeddings to apply other classifiers

4) Create encoder-decoders based on recurrent layers to obtain embeddings to apply other classifiers
